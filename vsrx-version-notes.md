It's critical that you review the [Junos OS dates and milestones](https://support.juniper.net/support/eol/software/junos/){: external} to determine whether or not Juniper still supports your Junos version. If your installed version is approaching its end of support from Juniper, then you should [Upgrade your vSRX](/docs/vsrx?topic=vsrx-upgrading-the-vsrx) immediately to maintain full support.
{: important}

All versions prior to 19.4R3-S2 are prone to clustering issues and crashing. As a result, it is critical that you upgrade to the latest available version, especially if you are currently using 19.4R2-S3 or below.
